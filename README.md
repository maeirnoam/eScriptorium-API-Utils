# eScriptorium-API-Utils

## Acknowledgment
The base functionalities in this project are based on Daniel Stökl Ben Ezra's public notebook for the eScriptorium API, originally shared by him [Daniel Stökl Ben Ezra] in the escripta\escriptorium gitter public channel: (https://matrix.to/#/!kwucPfyPlAhwGUrUBl:gitter.im/$8ARcbN8APVR5a7_42bYolZ7QHbiS6fLw_dtKw3UKxUk?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=uni-graz.at). The notebook, entitled "Public_Copy_of_Daniels_basic_functions_4_eScriptorium_API.ipynb," has been extented with additional functionalities I provide here. 

Please Note: This repository does not reproduce the original notebook. It assumes that users have their own copy or access to Daniel’s notebook from the forum or other sources. The code in this repository focuses on extending the original work with new functionalities and improvements to better interact with the eScriptorium API.
